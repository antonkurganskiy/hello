Tumor–normal studies (cancer research)
Tumor–normal studies determine the difference between tumor and nontumor genomes.
Researchers can employ whole-genome sequencing
(WGS) to monitor genomic changes that occur in a tumor, including the
presence of markers for good and poor prognosis.  Pan-cancer content aligned with key guidelinesDNA + RNA
and fusions
